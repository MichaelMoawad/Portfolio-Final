                            Following my Mechanical Engineering degree from the
                            University of Southampton, I have developed a keen
                            interest in Software Development.

                            As part of my final year Project during my degree, I
                            was tasked with creating a Graphical User Interface
                            to visually represent Vibrational Data acquired
                            through geo-phones using both Matlab and Python.
                            Following this, I have extended my skill set to now
                            becoming competent in HTML, CSS and Vanilla
                            JavaScript with a focus on Reactâ€™s framework.

                            I have been a Free-lance website developer
                            throughout the past year building WordPress websites
                            for clients. I have now started developing web
                            applications using React frameworks by designing and
                            implementing highly-responsive UI components while
                            using version control systems such as Git to update
                            and re-deploy live sites in a safe and appropriate
                            manner.
